### History
This desktop app was developed in the senior year of my high school and was submitted for my Python class project. This was developed in about 4-6 months as it required some learning. You can install this application in your Windows system with the Windows installer. Here's a [user guide](./FilmPyApp/Manual_for_FilmPy.pdf) to its interface.
